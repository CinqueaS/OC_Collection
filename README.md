## Goal

For this project I am attempting to have an app that stores the data and images of my and my friends' OCs(Original Characters). 

## Process

- Create Models for creators, characters and stories
- Seed data for every model
- Style a front end that allows a user to read data
- Link to any available story chapters
- Include a gallery for each character available

## CRUD
- Create an OC
- Reading the frontend
- Update stories, bios, and galleries for characters as needed
- Delete obsolete data that won't be needed if a character is scrapped
